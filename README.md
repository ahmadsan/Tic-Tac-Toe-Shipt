# Discussion
 I used java to build the app using android studio and showcase 
-	object-oriented programing
-	code organization
-	problem-solving

as much as I could. The app toke 1.5 days to be written and 1 day for testing and 1.5 days to improve visuals.

# Requirements
The Game Should...

-	Have 3x3 grid on which the players can play
-	Allow the players to take turns marking spaces on the 3x3 grid

As is often the case, the given specification is a little ambiguous in regards to some details about the game and the UI. Feel free to add constraints as you see fit in order to clarify the specification and limit the problem scope to something appropriate for your allotted time.

# Assumptions and/or constraints I came up with
-	Make the java code object oriented for possible upgrades and cleaner code 
-	Make the UI pleasant and easy on the eyes 
-	Have a help button to show the user the rules of the game 
-	A reset button the reset the game 
-	Game playable on both landscape and portrait orientation 
-	Make the game customizable and more relatable for users 
-	Show winner or tie message 
-	Have unit testing for the app to make sure it is working the way it is supposed to
-	Deploy app on play store and test it on a working device 

# Bugs and challenges
